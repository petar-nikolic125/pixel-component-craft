*Editor and Auth keep their own routes.*

2. **Navigation bar**
* Uses smooth-scroll (`scroll-behavior: smooth` or JS) to in-page anchors.
* Highlights the current section (IntersectionObserver → add `data-active`, or use `react-scrollspy`).
* Shows active colour *and underline bar* exactly like now.
* On `/editor` or `/sign-in`, highlight nothing (or “Editor”).

3. **Routing**
* Routes that used to point to `<Features />` etc. should now navigate to
  `/#features`, `/#pricing`, … (React Router + `useNavigate` or `<Navigate />`).
* Fallback `*` route → `/#hero`.

4. **Content integrity**
* Copy/paste each section’s JSX into new `Index.tsx` **without loss** (cards, grids, seal component, etc.).
* Keep the **metallic “Designed by Petar Nikolić” seal** at the end of the unified scroll.

5. **Mobile & edge cases**
* Test on ≤ 360 px width:
  * Headline wraps nicely, no overflow.
  * CTA buttons readable & tappable (≥ 44 px height).
  * Sections stack with proper padding.
* Hero 3-D canvas (`HeroFX`) continues to fade/clip correctly on scroll.
* Star grid background still fills viewport.
* No unexpected scroll-snap or jitter.

6. **Performance**
* Remove now-unused individual page components or turn them into thin shell routes that `navigate("#anchor")`.
* Lazy-load heavy assets (3-D, images) only once.

7. **Acceptance checklist (must pass before commit)**
- `npm run dev` opens `/` with full scroll experience.
- Navbar links scroll to correct anchors.
- “Try the Editor” button still routes to `/editor`.
- `/editor` and `/sign-in` remain external pages.
- `git status` clean; all lints/pre-commit hooks succeed.

(*EditorNewProfessional.tsx currently renders `/editor` – leave untouched.*)

## Deliverables
- Refactored `pages/Index.tsx` containing all sections.
- Updated navigation component (active-link logic).
- Adjusted routes in `App.tsx`.
- Any CSS/utility tweaks to ensure smooth scrolling & mobile friendliness.
- **One** clean commit with a concise message, e.g.  
`feat: merge marketing pages into single-scroll landing + nav scroll-spy`.
