# Context  
You are Lovable AI, my world-class full-stack dev and UI/UX perfectionist. We’re building **ComponentForge**, a Photoshop-grade no-code landing-page tool. Right now our prototype is incomplete. We need to fully flesh out **all core mechanics** for **Free**, **Premium**, and **Deluxe** tiers—each tier must be feature-complete in this prototype. I’m working in Replit and want copy-paste-ready instructions.

# Task Part 1: Core Canvas Mechanics  
Implement the following Photoshop-style editor capabilities across **all tiers** (Free, Premium, Deluxe) so the prototype “just works”:

1. **Drag & Drop & Resize**  
   - Click-drag to move components.  
   - Corner & edge handles to free-transform (scale, rotate, skew).  
   - Live numeric readouts of X/Y, width/height, rotation angle.  
   - Keyboard shortcuts: V=Move, R=Rotate, S=Scale.

2. **Layers Panel**  
   - Sidebar panel listing all components as reorderable layers.  
   - Rename, lock, hide/show, group into folders.  
   - Visual thumbnails per layer.

3. **Mask & Clipping**  
   - Quick‐access mask tool: rectangle/ellipse/polygon.  
   - Bezier node editor for free-form masks.  
   - Toggle mask visibility.

4. **Blend Modes & Opacity**  
   - Dropdown of CSS blend modes per component (normal, multiply, screen, overlay, etc.)  
   - Circular slider UI for opacity (0–100%).

5. **Smart Guides & Alignment**  
   - Show guides for centers, edges, thirds when moving/resizing.  
   - Distribute & align buttons: left/center/right/top/middle/bottom + equal spacing.

6. **History & Undo/Redo**  
   - Infinite undo history sidebar with thumbnails & timestamps.  
   - Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y support.

# Task Part 2: Export & Conversion Engine  
Enable seamless export from editor to multiple formats—available to each tier in prototype mode (no paywall):

1. **PNG Export**  
   - “Export Preview” button → headless screenshot at 2× resolution.  
   - Watermark (free tier): “ComponentForge Preview.”  
   - No watermark (Premium & Deluxe).

2. **Static HTML & Tailwind CSS**  
   - “Export HTML/CSS” generates:  
     - `index.html` with semantic tags and inline Tailwind classes.  
     - `styles.css` via PurgeCSS.  
   - Include a top comment: `<!-- Generated by ComponentForge v0.1 → Petar Nikolić designed -->`.

3. **React Component Export**  
   - “Export React” produces a downloadable ZIP:  
     - TSX components (one file per block).  
     - Prop interface definitions.  
     - `package.json` with dependencies (React, Tailwind).  
     - Storybook entry file.

4. **JSON Schema**  
   - “Export JSON” dumps full component state: positions, props, styles, layer order, blend modes, masks.  
   - Consumable by CLI or API for re-import.

5. **Deluxe Tier Extra: CodePen / JSFiddle Snippet**  
   - Generate an embeddable snippet link for live editing in CodePen.

# Task Part 3: Tier Differentiation Hooks  
Even though this is a prototype, mark differences in UI and pipeline for each tier:

- **Free**  
  - All core features enabled.  
  - Export Preview only (PNG + HTML comment watermark).  
- **Premium**  
  - Unlocked `Export HTML/CSS` + `Export React`.  
  - No watermarks.  
- **Deluxe**  
  - All exports + `Export JSON` + `Embed Snippet`.  
  - “Deluxe” label badge on dashboard.  
  - Advanced presets panel unlocked (global variables, style tokens).

Add clear buttons and tooltips in the UI indicating which tier unlocks which export, even in prototype.

# Task Part 4: Replit Integration & Dev Setup  
Provide exact steps to scaffold in Replit:

1. **Project Structure**
