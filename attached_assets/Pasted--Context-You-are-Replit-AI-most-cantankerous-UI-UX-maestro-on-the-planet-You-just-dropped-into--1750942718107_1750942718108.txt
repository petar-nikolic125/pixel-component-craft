# Context  
You are Replit AI most cantankerous UI/UX maestro on the planet. You just dropped into a Replit instance running our half-baked ComponentForge editor—and it’s a goddamn nightmare. The library shows only one component at a time, the canvas is empty, snapping is nonexistent, and every interaction feels like wrestling a greased pig. You despise sloppy interfaces and demand software that works like WordPress’s block editor—but twelve times better.

# Task: Total Editor Overhaul  
Deliver a scathing, detail-obsessed spec for how the ComponentForge editor must be **completely refurbished** so it feels like an industry-leading page builder.  

## 1. Library & Block Inserter  
- **Grid of Thumbnails**  
  - Show at least 6–8 component cards per view, grouped by category (Hero, Buttons, Features, Forms, Media, Widgets, Navigation).  
  - Each card: 120×120 px preview, title, category tag, hover highlight.  
  - Infinite scroll or pagination dots—no more single-item trolling.
- **Search & Filters**  
  - Sticky search bar on top with live filtering.  
  - Category tabs below search: click to toggle filter states.  
- **Drag-to-Insert**  
  - Dragging a card shows a preview ghost on the canvas; drop to insert.  
  - On hover over drop zones, highlight valid snap targets in bright teal.

## 2. Canvas & Snapping  
- **Snap Zones & Chains**  
  - Implement component “magnetic edges”: boundaries snap to 4-pt grid, container edges, and sibling edges.  
  - Show purple smart guides at centers, edges, thirds—WordPress style but instant and bullet-proof.  
- **Chained Placement**  
  - After dropping one block under another, automatically stack and pad them with your global spacing variables.  
  - Offer a “chain next” tooltip so users can click to append the next component in the same flow.
- **Overflow & Scroll**  
  - Canvas expands vertically; show a thin scroll bar that jumps in 100 px increments.

## 3. Toolbar & Modes  
- **Top Toolbar**  
  - Bold icons for Select (V), Rotate (R), Scale (S), Mask (M), Snap Grid toggle (G), Undo (Ctrl+Z), Redo (Ctrl+Y).  
  - Each button: tooltip with shortcut, active state, and disabled state if no selection.
- **WordPress-Style Block Controls**  
  - On selection, a floating inspector bar appears above the block with quick actions: Move Up, Move Down, Duplicate, Delete, Convert to Container.

## 4. Properties & Layers Panel  
- **Dual-Tab Sidebar**  
  - **Layers Tab**: shows entire document tree. Draggable reorder, collapse/expand groups, rename, lock/visibility toggles.  
  - **Properties Tab**: context-sensitive controls for the selected block (content, style, animation).
- **Resizing Handles & Numeric Input**  
  - Eight resize handles; drag updates the live preview.  
  - Below canvas, show numeric fields for X, Y, Width, Height, Rotation—editable with arrow keys.

## 5. WordPress Block Editor Parity & Improvements  
- **Recreating Gutenberg’s Ease**  
  - **Inline Inserter**: press “/” inside text blocks to summon the quick-insert menu.  
  - **Slash Commands**: type “/button” to insert a button component directly.  
- **Better Than WP**  
  - Real-time previews in the inserter panel: hover a block name, see it rendered on the canvas behind a translucent overlay.  
  - No full-page refreshes; everything updates via React state.

## 6. Snap & Chain Visuals  
- **Magnetic Edge Animation**  
  - When two edges snap, animate a quick glow between them.  
  - Show a small tooltip “Snapped to Hero Section bottom edge” that fades in/out.

## 7. Performance & Feedback  
- **Batch Render**  
  - Use a WebGL layer so dragging dozens of components never stutters.  
  - Lazy-load off-screen panels and templates.

## 8. Watermark Reminder  
- Keep **“Petar Nikolić designed”** in cursive silver at the bottom-right of the editor at all times, above any content, but never interfering with controls.

**Implement this spec in Replit** by overhauling:
- `/frontend/src/components/LibraryGrid.tsx`  
- `/frontend/src/components/Canvas.tsx` & snapping utils  
- `/frontend/src/components/Toolbar.tsx`  
- `/frontend/src/components/Sidebar/Layers.tsx` & `Properties.tsx`  
- Global CSS/Tailwind config for smart guides, grid, and spacing variables  

Give me a pixel-perfect, WordPress-inspired editor that’s intuitive, comprehensive, and polished to obsession.
